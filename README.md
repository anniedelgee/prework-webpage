# Prework Study Guide Webpage by Anniedelgee pt II
## Description 
I created this second prework study guide webpage because i had an issue deploying the first one. After going back over the entire project with this second edition, i realised it was a mistake i made in the first phases of moving the files into a subfolder within the working folder preventing the html file from being accessed and linked properly to the css and js files in the assets folder. Although time-consuming it was good to go back over the process, as this has been my first web development project.
